## Experience
---
## Truffle DSP (online advertising)
ML Developer, July 2021 - currently

Click-Through Rate Prediction (CTR) modelling and feature generation.
* Developed and prepared for the production pipeline the model to increase CTR. Tested various assumptions on the features derived from the basic features provided by SSP.

*Tools:* catboost, airflow , pandas

### SUEK (coal mining)
Project Lead, July 2020 - June 2021

Business optimization modelling with the objective to reduce costs / increase incoming cashflow by getting optimal production volumes, modes and delivery routes.
* Developed and delivered the optimization model for Kuzbass-Khakasia mines optimal production and distribution.
* Developed and delivered lignite coal open-pits optimal production and distribution (subject to the consumers demand and logistics restrictions).
* Delivered and tested lignite coal optimal production and distribution with the multiple demand scenarios.

The models contrinbuted to the management and BoD decisions regarding the company strategy. 

*Tools:* gekko, cvxopt, pandas
* Washing facilities yields prediction based on the incoming product characteristics and the equipment.

The ML model was applied as incoming info source for the optimization model. 

*Tools:* tensorflow.keras, pandas

### JCS AtomStroyExport (nuclear power plant design & construction)
Expert, December 2016 - June 2020

ML modelling to predict nuclear powerplant construction bill of works.
* Equipment price prediction based on its technical characteristics
* Research of the specific equipment dependency on the market indices
*Tools:* tensorflow.keras, xgboost, catboost, scikit, pandas, autogluon

The model used as the test case to reduce the time required to get economics while designing the power-plant elements.

Methodology development:
* Development of the economics methodology for the software development based on the cost functional analysis.

### Wintershall Russland GmbH, ZAO Achimgaz (oil & gas production)
Specialist, March 2010 - November 2016
Forward modelling.
* Financial and strategic KPI-s models for the subsidiaries.

The models and the derived strategy recommendations were delivered for the management decisions.
